# flow.py
 
A wrapper for Flow Launcher's V2 python api using jsonrpc.

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appriciated, I just have a couple of requests:
1. Your code is run through isort and black before a PR is made

> After installing the dependencies from `requirements-dev.txt`, run the `run_formatters.bat` file to run the formatters.

2. Your code is properly typed
3. Your code is tested
4. Your code is documented (docstrings)

> The library doesn't currently have docstrings, but they will come closer to the first publishment.
